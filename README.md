# Coding-Assessment
This repository is an exhibition of a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The application features a number of comprehensive coding questions to gauge the average bootcamp student's knowledge on fundamentals. Incorrect answers will penalize the user's score and fixed time allotted for the quiz. 

## Why do coding assessments matter?
Coding assessments are an important part of the interview process for developers. In fact, employers often use them to filter out job candidates with a cut-off score. Taking advantage of these opportunities should help prepare applicants to shine during the technical interview process!
